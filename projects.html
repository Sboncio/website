                    I am currently working on an autonomous drone that can be used for 
                    autonomous drone racing. I aim to follow the complete creation lifecycle
                    of the project, from design and printing of the chassis, the implementation 
                    of the separate electronics to the complete creation of the code from the 
                    ground up.

                Self-Navigating Robot
            </h4>
            <p>
                For my dissertation, I created a control system for a differential drive robot
                that could navigate unknown environments to a destination, while avoiding both
                static and moving obstacles. When active, the robot would also create a map of
                its environment for future reference, and would track its route along the map.
                The project was created using ROS and C++, with a GUI created using Python
                to activate and control the robot when required.

                Autonomous Collision Detection and Avoidance System
            </h4>
            <p>
                A collision detection and avoidance system was created for self-driving cars
                to safely detect, asses and avoid obstacles safely while travelling. The system
                consisted of several hundred fuzzy logic rules, in order to handle any possible
                combination of vehicle speed, obstacle direction and obstacle size.
                This system was created using the Matlab scripting language, with testing 
                scenarios being sequentially generated to ensure safety in all possible combination
                of conditions.
