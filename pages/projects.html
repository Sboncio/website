        <h5>Chatbot</h5>
        <hr />
        One of my most exciting current projects is to create a chatbot for this very
        website. I'm designing it to talk to potential employers and recruiters who would
        like to ask for more information regarding myself, and some niche questions that 
        might have a funny answer or two.

        <h5>Personal Website</h5>
        <hr />
        This website itself is one of my personal projects. Originally started as an example
        for the "IBM CIC Code The Future" course I tutored, it has evolved into a type of portfolio 
        and sandbox for me to try new things and play around with ideas.

    <h5>Autonomous Drone</h5>
    <hr />
    I am currently 
    working on an autonomous drone that can be used for 
    autonomous drone racing. I aim to follow the complete creation lifecycle
    of the project, from design and printing of the chassis, the implementation 
    of the separate electronics to the complete creation of the code from the 
    ground up.

    <h5>Self-Navigating Robot</h5>
    <hr />
    I created a control system for a differential drive robot
            that could navigate unknown environments to a destination, while avoiding both
            static and moving obstacles. When active, the robot would also create a map of
            its environment for future reference, and would track its route along the map.
            The project was created using ROS and C++, with a GUI created using Python
            to activate and control the robot when required.

        <h5>Collision Detection System</h5>
        <hr />
        A collision detection and avoidance system was created for self-driving cars
        to safely detect, asses and avoid obstacles safely while travelling. The system
        consisted of several hundred fuzzy logic rules, in order to handle any possible
        combination of vehicle speed, obstacle direction and obstacle size.
        This system was created using the Matlab scripting language, with testing 
        scenarios being sequentially generated to ensure safety in all possible combination
        of conditions.
