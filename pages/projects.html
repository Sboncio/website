    <h5>Autonomous Drone</h5>
    I am currently 
    working on an autonomous drone that can be used for 
    autonomous drone racing. I aim to follow the complete creation lifecycle
    of the project, from design and printing of the chassis, the implementation 
    of the separate electronics to the complete creation of the code from the 
    ground up.

    <h5>Self-Navigating Robot</h5>
    I created a control system for a differential drive robot
            that could navigate unknown environments to a destination, while avoiding both
            static and moving obstacles. When active, the robot would also create a map of
            its environment for future reference, and would track its route along the map.
            The project was created using ROS and C++, with a GUI created using Python
            to activate and control the robot when required.

        <h5>Collision Detection System</h5>
        A collision detection and avoidance system was created for self-driving cars
        to safely detect, asses and avoid obstacles safely while travelling. The system
        consisted of several hundred fuzzy logic rules, in order to handle any possible
        combination of vehicle speed, obstacle direction and obstacle size.
        This system was created using the Matlab scripting language, with testing 
        scenarios being sequentially generated to ensure safety in all possible combination
        of conditions.
