        <p>Just for the record, I despise Visual Basic. I spent two years using it in college
            and it was a horrible experience, especially after learning other programming Languages
            like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. 
            Why am I learning it? For a project. I was not given a choice in what language I would use.
            Why have a made a whole new page purely dedicated to complaining about it?
            Because I will do anything to avoid using it.
