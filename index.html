            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Samuel Asquith, and I'm currently a developer working for IBM.</p>
            <p>I work mainly with web app development, focusing on both the front and back-end 
                design. 
                I have a passion for artificial intelligence and robotics, working on projects
                involving both in my spare time. Wanting to use my passion, my career ambition
                is to work on robots that make use of artificial intelligence to help. These include
                self-driving cars, autonomous rescue robots, and robots that can be used in the
                health care industry.

                Originally from South Wales, I moved to Leicester for university in 2017. At the 
                start of the Covid-19 pandemic, I returned to Wales where I worked as a DevOps
                consultant for six months. After I started at IBM in Februrary 2021, I returned
                to Leicester.
