                <h5>Who am I?</h5>
                <hr />
                I work mainly with web app development, focusing on both the front and back-end 
                    design. 
                    I have a passion for artificial intelligence and robotics, working on projects
                    involving both in my spare time. Wanting to use my passion, my career ambition
                    is to work on robots that make use of artificial intelligence to help. These include
                    self-driving cars, autonomous rescue robots, and robots that can be used in the
                    health care industry.

                <hr />
                Originally from South Wales, I moved to Leicester for university in 2017. At the 
                start of the Covid-19 pandemic, I returned to Wales where I worked as a DevOps
                consultant for six months. After I started at IBM in Februrary 2021, I returned
                to Leicester, but am hoping my work will take me all over the world.

                <h5>What is this website?</h5>
                <hr />
                I made this website as an addition to my CV, providing more information than I 
                    can reasonably put on a single document. It's meant to inform the viewer about my 
                    career, ambitions, current projects and skills. My aim is to constantly update
                    this website as my skills, projects and careers change with time.
