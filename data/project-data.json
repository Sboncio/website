When active, the robot would also create a map of its environment for future reference, and would track its route along the map. The project was created using ROS and C++, with a GUI created using Python to activate and control the robot when required.",

The system consisted of several hundred fuzzy logic rules, in order to handle any possible combination of vehicle speed, obstacle direction and obstacle size. This system was created using the Matlab scripting language, with testing scenarios being sequentially generated to ensure safety in all possible combination of conditions.",
